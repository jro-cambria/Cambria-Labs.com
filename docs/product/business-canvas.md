# Business Canvas

The business canvas helps us stay disciplined about documenting and validating our riskiest business model hypotheses. The canvas is a roadmap for validating and developing a business plan. It’s an important tool to help us stay aligned on what a successful business looks like.

The business canvas was developed to help entrepreneurs define new products. It can also be used successfully to summarize how an existing product drives business impact, and where there may be opportunities for optimization.

## Components of a Business Canvas

- The **unique value proposition** is a clear and concise message that states how we are unique and worth buying/engaging with.
- **Advantage** is something we have that can’t be easily bought or copied.
