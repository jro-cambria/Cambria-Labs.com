# Agile Product Team Allocation
Updated: 2024-01-16 / JRO

### Vision
- Plan the future
- Rotation/assignment recommendations based on:
  - Skillset
  - Desired skillset
  - Project need
  - Vacations
  - Duration of current assignment
- Keep track of billing


## Roles
- AD / OD

### Assumptions
- A developer is on one and only one project per week
- Project allocations span a full week
- Developers are fungible, to a first approximation
- Projects are fungible, to a first approximation
- There are no “special” or limited resources, to a first approximation
- All projects are staffed or not - there is no maintenance mode

### Avoid
- People are on more than one project

### Views
- This week
- Next week
- 4, 8, 12 week view for all projects
- Per project views
- Per office views
- Views by Skill (e.g. ruby, java, Postgres, etc)
- Historical views,
- Summary of everyone ever assigned to a project

### Lo-fi version
- This Week
  - 1 x Magnet for each Team Member
- Next Week
- - 1 x Magnet for each Team Member
- Whiteboard 
  - (add photo examples)

### Topics
- Utilization
  - Allocations Targets
  - Utilization percentages
- Vacation / Availability
- Financial
  - Billing
  - Financial Forcasting
- Improvement
  - Career Growth (Skills & Experiences)
- Future Plans / Reliability
  - Committed / Holding

### Routines
- Daily allocations meeting
  - Ensure 1-4 weeks allocation is accurate
  - What is coming?
  - Potential future trades (explain further)
- Weekly allocations meeting
  - (What's done daily vs weekly?)
