# Agile Planning

Knowing what to do next is one of the Product Manager's most important skills. An effective product plan is made up of many small, independent user stories. This allows us to plan and easily respond to change.



## The Product Manager As Planner

The Product Manager is accountable for planning the work efficiently. This means:

- Taking a large scope of work and breaking it down into manageable steps to complete it
-  Allowing focus on completing the next priority in the list
- Seeing progress and the big picture

Knowing how to prioritize, estimate and organize stories and track team velocity is fundamental to good project planning.



## All Stories Must be Prioritized

Guided by input from users, stakeholders and the development team, the Product Manager weighs user value, business value, development risk and dependencies against each other to determine the priority of a story.

A story’s position in the backlog reveals its priority; **the most important story is at the very top** while the least important story is at the bottom. This makes it obvious which task the team will work on next.

Stories’ priorities can change as business priorities change.

## User Stories Must be Estimated

All user stories need to be given a point estimate before developers can work on them. New stories are discussed in the weekly Iteration Planning Meeting. Once everyone understands the purpose of the story and agrees on the simplest way to accomplish it, the team can agree on its size.

Knowing the relative complexity of stories helps the Product Manager prioritize and set expectations with stakeholders.

For instance, we can decide to prioritize a big story or three small stories – the amount of work would be about the same but in the first case we ship one larger feature whereas in the second case we ship three smaller features. It is important that the team focuses on complexity rather than effort as the points are ultimately a planning tool and not an exact time estimate.

Bugs and chores are not given point estimates. The idea is that these two story types emerge over time, and while they do take time to address, they’re an ongoing and fairly consistent cost.

## Larger Stories Are Grouped Into Epics

A group of stories that represent a larger features is called an epic. Epics convey the overall big picture priorities.

## Velocity is a Measure of Average Delivered Story Points

Average velocity is an indicator of how many points a team can be expected to deliver in a given iteration. It is calculated by averaging the points delivered in previous iterations. Only completed stories count toward velocity which is why regular story acceptance is important.

When our team gets good at building up features with small, consistently-sized stories, the team gets better at delivering about the same amount of work each iteration. With lower volatility, the team’s velocity becomes a more useful planning tool. The iterations planned into the backlog reflect past reality and are useful predictions.

## Respond to Change

When building software it’s impossible to gather all the requirements up front. Responding to change requires knowing how to re-prioritize, estimate & organize stories.
