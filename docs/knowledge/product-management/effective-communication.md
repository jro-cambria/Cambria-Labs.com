# Effective Communication
To launch successful products, we build a shared understanding with the team,  stakeholders and your sponsors of the product and each iteration of it.

## Strong Communication Skills Help  Lead Without Authority
Product Managers champeon the product within the organization, making trade-offs with stakeholders and other product teams, and facilitating daily tactical decisions with the  team. Product Managers inspire trust, and motivate and influence people to help the  team launch a successful product to market. The strength of our communication skills will determine how well we develop  credibility and strong relationships. 

### Stakeholders
Functional teams like legal, security, sales and marketing want to know that we understand their needs and how the product supports their goals. For instance, marketing will want to know how the product will drive leads, and sales will want to know how the product will help close those leads.

### Sponsors
Executive sponsors want to know how the product is increasing the bottom line. Share with them the strategic objectives and targets  we working towards. Document and share the business impact the product is having.

### Core team
Physical co-location creates ideal conditions for short feedback loops. Product Managers are responsive to the  team’s communication needs by being present and available. Product Managers share incoming information from sponsors and stakeholders quickly and as appropriate – shield the team from information overload while making sure they have the information they need to do their work.

### Others
We may be working very differently from other teams in your organization. Help them understand how being lean/agile/user-centered impacts the cadence, needs, health and success of your product and your product team.

## Tips For Effective Communication
### Tell a story
Why does the product exist? Why does it matter? A compelling product story will make the product feel real and create an emotional bond to it, which will make people invested in its success. Use anecdotes, user journeys, prototypes, videos and other artifacts to help tell your product’s story.

### Explain the big picture
Share the vision, strategy and roadmap. Help everyone involved understand what outcomes we are working towards and how we know when we have  succeeded.

### Be believable
When we communicate product decisions, make sure you do so with logic, empirical evidence, enthusiasm and a focus on driving business impact by satisfying customer needs and desires. Let product designers and anchors communicate the rationale behind design decisions and technical decisions.

### Adjust the message and content to the audience. 
Tell them what they need to know. Only share the information they need to make a decision or take action.

### Be honest
When new information arrives that necessitates a shake-up of the product plan, have the courage to recognize  issues, communicate new data and insights back to the team and stakeholders, and facilitate the creation and implementation of a new plan.

### Be proactive
To build trust with stakeholders and collaborators, we share updates with them proactively. Don't wait till the last minute, or when we need something, to reach out.

### Listen well
Active listening will help us build stronger relationships and may also help us gain new insights that improve the product.
