# Terminology
## A
**Agile** - A group of product development methods based on iterative and incremental development, in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It is a conceptual framework that promotes well planned, small iterations throughout the development cycle.

**Anchor Role** - An experienced developer who leads the technical aspects of the project from from start to end. The anchor acts as a resource for the rest of the development team for technical and non- technical issues.

## B
**Backlog** - The backlog is a list of prioritized stories that make up the planned work for the current iteration. Stories can be added and removed from the backlog and re-prioritized as necessary during an iteration.

**Balanced Team** - An autonomous team that has people with a variety of skills and perspectives that support each other towards a shared goal. The team values cross-disciplinary collaboration and iterative delivery.

**Blocker** - A situation or issue, brought up at project stand-up, that is delaying or preventing project progress. The team self-organizes to resolve the blocker, and when it cannot be unblocked by the team, it can be escalated to the Client Liason and/or stakeholders.

**Build, Measure, Learn** - A core component of Agile Methodology. Build-Measure-Learn is a feedback loop in which we first figure out what problem needs to be solved, then build and test the smallest possible solution.

## C

**Design Review** - A weekly team meeting to get an update on the progress of design and research. The goal of a design review is for a designer to leave the meeting with a clear list of updates to the designs and workflows they’ve presented based on feedback from developers, Product Managers, and client stakeholders on feasibility, business value, brand, priority, and scope.

**Design Studio** - A solution brainstorming activity a Designer leads to gather ideas in the form of sketches.

## E
**Empathy** - Empathy is an ability to understand what other people are thinking and feeling. We hire for empathy and compassion because it enables us to be kind and effective collaborators. Good collaborators build happier teams.

**Epic** - An epic is a collection of stories that make up a larger product release, feature set, or development focus. Epics are useful for prioritizing groups of stories against other groups of stories.

## I
**Iteration** - A 1-week planning cycle. Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go live. This iterative process allows for changes as business requirements evolve. Daily and weekly product releases provide constant validation that the product meets the business requirements. 

**Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM)** - IPM stands for Iteration Planning Meeting. A weekly meeting at the start of an iteration, during which the team reviews the upcoming stories in the backlog, ensures the backlog is full for the next two or three iterations, confirms the prioritization of stories, and estimates any unestimated stories using a point system.

## L
**Lean** - Lean is the practice of build products that deliver the most value for your customers and minimizing waste by systematically identifying assumptions and validating with actual users.

## M
**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** - A Minimum Viable Product is the cheapest, fastest, simplest thing that can help validate or invalidate hypothesis about customer behavior.

## P
**Pair Collaborating** - Pair Collaborationg is the practice of having two team members work together  to complete each task. We pair all of the time. This practice of focusing two minds on the same challenge leads to better decisions the first time around, fewer knowledge gaps, and continual implicit training and knowledge transfer. Pairing results in fewer defects, better products, and ultimately much more sustainably efficient development. As pairs rotate, knowledge is spread rapidly through the team, avoiding silos of knowledge and allowing for team growth.

**Persona** - A model of a user of the product/service based on similar needs, goals, context, and tasks of many actual users. Developed through user research. Used to gain and retain empathy for the users we are solving for.

**Pointing** - In order to measure a story’s complexity, we use a point system of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 points. During an Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM), team members   discuss and agree on a point estimate that reflects the story’s complexity to the best of their understanding. Points do not reflect a measure of how much time a story will take to complete, since time is especially difficult to estimate, and can vary based on external factors. Measuring relative complexity is easier, and allows for much more consistent measures of team progress.

**"Pivot or Persevere"** - A pivot is a change in strategy, not in vision. To pivot means to change the business model, product, or target market when we learn, based on feedback from the market, that our current plan isn’t working. To persevere means to continue to follow our plan based on feedback. We regularly revisit our  strategy in a “Pivot or Persevere” meeting.

## R
**Rapid Prototyping** - The quick and early development of a small-scale prototype used to test out certain key features of the product design. Useful for learning quickly and cheaply.

**Risk (product)** - Probability of wasting time and resources on features that don’t provide business or user value.

**Retrospective (Retro)** - This  meeting provides a team an opportunity to give positive and negative feedback to each other, in a structured way, that leads to action. Team members  each identify aspects of the previous week that went well, and aspects that went poorly. We  reflect on issues ranging from technical choices, to inter-role communication, to working environment. These thoughts are then grouped into themes. The team brainstorms and assigns actions  to remedy any issues. Each Retro  begins with a review of last week’s action items to improve accountability.

## S
**Stand-up** - A daily short meeting (usually first thing in the morning) to discuss what was accomplished the previous day, share  information that is valuable to the entire team, ask for help, and determine pairs for the day. The meeting is meant to be as short as possible, and any discussions that only involve a subset of the team are moved into separate meetings.

**Stakeholder** - An individual who stands to gain or lose from the success or failure of a product/feature/solution. They understand and represent business interests and/or functional teams. They may also possess valuable knowledge about customers and end users.

**Style guide** - A document that serves as a guide for visual design elements. A style guide is a living document, which details all the various elements and  modules of the product.

## T

**Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a product development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: developer writes an automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## U
**User-Centered Design (UCD)** - An approach to product design where the user is put at the front and center of every design activity. User-centered design (UCD) is a way to de-risk the product early and often. The team involves representative end-users throughout the process of discovering, defining, design, developing, delivering and optimizing the product, in order to test whether the features and user experience are useful and usable.

## V
**Velocity** - Velocity is a measure of how many points a team can be expected to deliver in a given iteration. It is calculated by averaging the points delivered in previous iterations.

**Volatility** - Volatility is a measure of how variable a team’s velocity is.

## X
**Extreme Programming (XP)** - Extreme Programming (XP) is a flavor of agile software development. Elements of XP include: programming in pairs, automated testing of all code, avoiding programming of features until they are actually needed, simplicity and clarity in code, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers.
