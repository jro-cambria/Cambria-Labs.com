# Product Assumptions & Risks

## Untested Assumptions Create Risk

Before executing on product ideas, teams should clarify their thought process and test their ideas so that they move forward with confidence. We need to answer some important questions before we are ready to build a product.

### Product risk

- Do we have a meaningful problem to solve? 
- Can we validate a minimum viable solution that people find useful?
-  Can we scale that solution?

### Customer Risk

- Are there enough people who have the pain? 
- Can we effectively reach these people?
- Can we effectively reach these people at scale?

### Business Risk

- Will a sufficient number of people pay enough for the product?
- Can we define cost and revenue structures that enable us to have a sustainable business?

### Technology Risk

- Can we implement the solution well?
- Can we maintain and continue evolving the product over time?



### Team Risk

- Can we take action and move forward effectively?
- Do we have access to users?
- Do we have access to the business context we need?
- Can we ship to production?
- Can we maintain a sustainable pace as a team?
- Do we have a clear shared focus, so that we can move quickly and do the right things
- Do we have the right skills and perspectives available and access to all the inputs we need to make good decisions?



## How Do We De-risk Our Product?

- Validate a meaningful problem. This is a need or desire that is strongly felt by a sufficient number of people.
-  Validate a solution that is feasible, desirable and viable. This is a way to address the need or desire such that people are satisfied, and will pay for it.
- Validate a viable business model. Defining a business around our product.

This requires us to continuously prioritize our riskiest assumptions, design and run experiments, analyze the experiment data and determine whether our assumptions were validated or invalidated.
