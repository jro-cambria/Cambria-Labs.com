# When to Ship Products?

The more often we ship, the more often we deliver concrete value to our customers and validate our product strategy.

## Ship Early and Often

The ultimate goal of any product team is to ship the right working features to users. It’s not until our customers interact with our features that we truly know whether we built the right features, and designed and implemented them right.

User testing without putting software in the real hands of active users is very limited in terms of what we can learn. Working software can help answer questions like “Have we built enough? Are we focusing on the most important feature first? Are we likely to hit the targets that the business believes we're going to hit?”

We want to keep this feedback loop with our users as short as possible so that we can continuously validate our product direction. Should we go deeper on features we have or go wider on new features? Based on user value, business objectives and technical constraints, we should figure out what the smallest thing is that we can release to help collect data on what our users find valuable to inform our work.

We also want to make our releases as easy and cheap as possible. If releases are risky, expensive and cumbersome, we will push them off. If releasing is a big, risky and expensive undertaking, we’ll only be able to do it occasionally. A repeatable, regular, successful, reliable and cost-effective release process is critical to our ability to continuously.

## What's the Path to Production?

Be proactive about understanding and satisfying the requirements to reach the product environment in your organization. This may take longer than expected and become a blocker for the team. 

## Deliver small chunks of value. 

Frequently releasing thin slices of our product enables us to easily roll back any changes, and debug issues quickly.

## Can We Ship?

Because our ability to ship depends on our delivery infrastructure, “Can we ship” is a technical decision. Our ideal state is to always be able to ship, so that we can release new features when it makes sense to do so from a business perspective.

Our ability to ship is impacted by:

- Quality
- Test coverage
- Story size and quality

## Should We Ship?
The decision to release should come from the business. We need to weigh the user value we can deliver right now against the cost and risk of shipping. We do this by gathering input around:
- **User needs**. How urgently do users need a new feature or refined feature design?
- **Stakeholders**. Are marketing, sales, customer service and other teams ready to support the features we want to ship?
- **Other Teams**. If we depend on other teams  before we can release, we need to make sure those components are ready for us to use.
- **Release size**. The bigger, the riskier.
- **How manual our process is**. The more manual, the
more expensive.
- **Delivery infrastructure**. How easy it is to push to production?
