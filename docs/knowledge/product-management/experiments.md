# Experiments

Ask: “What outcome do we predict this feature will have?” and validate your answer with empirical data.

## Hypothesis-Driven Product Management
Hypothesis-driven product management is the practice of treating the development of new products as running a series of experiments. Instead of formulating requirements, we formulate hypotheses along with some validation criteria that state how strong of a signal we need to consider the hypothesis true. We use what we learn from each experiment to iterate on our ideas until we get where we want to be, or, until we determine that the product isn’t viable and cancel the effort.



## Leap of Faith Assumptions
These are the riskiest assumptions we make about our idea. Our riskiest assumptions should align with the business outcomes or product goals we are working towards. By identifying our riskiest assumptions early and testing them through experiments, we dramatically reduce the uncertainty associated with our product ideas. 

Instead of trying to get it right from the start, we try to get it right one small piece at a time. We test our risky assumptions systemically in order of potential impact:
- Problem/solution fit: Have we found a problem worth solving? Can we solve it?
- Product/market fit: Have we built something the market wants?
- Scale: Have we found a sustainable business model?

## Experiments Test Our Assumptions

A "lean experiment" is the smallest experiment we can run to quickly test our assumption. We start small and fast, and then increase the scale and scope of our experiments over time.

An experiment consist of three parts: a hypothesis, a test and validation criteria.

- The **hypothesis** is falsifiable version of our assumption. Remember to make sure you are only testing one variable in each hypothesis, otherwise you won’t get reliable data.

- The **test** is how we intend to test our hypothesis, and provide it true or false.

- The **validation criteria** is the signal we need to see to consider the hypothesis true.



## Experiment Template

### HYPOTHESIS

We believe that **(this capability)** will result in **(this outcome)**.

### TEST

We will do/make **(this test)**.

### VALIDATION CRITERIA

We will know that our hypothesis is valid if we observe/measure **(this outcome)**.

## Validation Criteria

We need to determine how much evidence is enough for us to consider an assumption validated. These are some general rules to consider:

- During discovery, talk to as many people as possible
- During usability testing, 5 people will help you identify 80% of the issues
- If your organization is new to hypothesis-driven product development, define your validation criteria based on what you need to feel confident to justify the product decision

## Experiment Techniques

There are many types of experiments we can conduct to test our hypotheses. Which experiment type is right depends on what we’re looking to learn.



### Customer Interviews

Validate assumptions about

- What our customers’ problems are
- How they want to solve their problem
- What is standing in their way
- Who our customer segments are
-  identify early adopters.



### Low Fidelity Prototypes

Rough, early, testable representations of concepts that help us validate those concepts early on in the design process.


### High Fidelity Prototypes

Detailed, early, testable representations of concepts that are clickable/tappable that help us validate those concepts midway and late in the design process.

### Walking Skeleton Test

A tiny implementation of the system that performs an end-to-end function. Helps us validate technical feasibility.

### Concierge Test

A technique to replace a complex automated technical solution with humans who directly interact with the customer. Helps us validate whether anyone wants our product.

### Wizard of Oz Test

A technique to replace the product backend with humans. The customer believes they are interacting with an automated solution. Helps us validate whether anyone wants our product.

### Smoke Test

Commonly a website that describes the product’s value proposition and asks customers to sign up for the product before it’s available. Helps us validate whether anyone wants our product.

### A/B Test

A comparison of two versions of a product or feature to see which one performs best. Works best with large sets of users for small incremental optimizations of an experience and business model.
