# Outcome Roadmap

## Overview

Our roadmap communicates how we intend to realize our [Product Strategy](product-strategy.md). It aligns the product work to our  [Business Goals](business-goals.md)  and helps communicate the current and future state of the product. This helps the team understand what is coming up next,  and to coordinate joint efforts and dependencies with other teams.

Intended for: 

- Product sponsors
- Stakeholders 
- Sales
- Marketing
- Customer support

Rather than try to optimize for predictability in an inherently unpredictable world, we optimize for learning and responding to change as quickly and cheaply as possible. With the [Product Vision](product-vision.md)  as our north star, we articulate direction for getting to that vision (our [Product Strategy](product-strategy.md)) and define a plan for our immediate next steps (our product roadmap). 



## Outcomes > Features

Our roadmap emphasizes the results we want to create – like improved product and business metrics – rather than the features we believe should be part of our product. This approach creates agreement on what success looks like, while enabling us to be flexible in our solution. Being **outcome-oriented** enables us to iterate towards the best solution as we learn more about the market, our customers and users and what’s technically feasible.

Our outcome based approach to planning helps us:

- Create shared understanding around why we are building the product
- Create alignment between stakeholders, sponsors and the product team
- Prioritize feature ideas and requests better, because our team mandate is clearer
- Feel more engaged in our work by being empowered to solve a problem
- Figure out which parts of our  [Product Strategy](product-strategy.md) are working and which are not
