# Product Goals & Measurable Objectives


## Overview

To know whether we are on the right track to deliver on our product goals, we need to establish clear objectives and metrics.

### What are Goals?

Goals have a long timeframe, articulate a high level outcome we strive towards, and may not be directly tangible or measurable. They are our desired outcomes and are often strategic in nature - like "increase sales" or "keep customers happy".

### What are Objectives?

Objectives are the specific, measurable, achievable and tangible actions we take to realize our goals. One goal can be broken down into several objectives. This helps us break down a big challenge into many smaller challenges. A good practice is to make sure that objectives are SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-bound.

### Clear Goals and Objectives Help Maximize Value and Minimize Waste

It's important that we have clarity on why we invest time in various activities, such as talking to customers, exploring a certain technology, or building a feature. Everything we spend time, money and effort on should intend to help us realize an important objective.
