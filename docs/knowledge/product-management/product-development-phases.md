# Product Development Phases



We use a "Build-Measure-Learn‚Äù feedback cycle to continuously turn uncertainties and assumptions into facts. Starting with ideas, we identify our riskiest Assumptions, build simple tests, run those tests, analyze the test data and then use what we learn to inform our next steps. 

We don't treat product definition, design, development, and testing as separate phases. Instead, we do all of these activities in parallel via short and frequent cycles throughout the product life cycle.

## Measuring Progress
We look at two things to determine if we are making progress:

  - Validated learning, which de-risks our product and business
  - Working software, which delivers value to our customers, and thus to our business
