# Iteration Planning Meeting

The Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM) is core to an agile development practice and provides the opportunity for product manager(s) to communicate the vision for the upcoming iteration.



## Frame the conversation.

Establish the theme of the next week(s), and tie it back to product and project goals. For example: "Last week we focused on making our site more mobile-friendly, and this week we're going to revisit the sign-up flow with some improvements. This will help us convert more people coming in from our new mobile marketing campaign."



## Clarify the stories. 

Start by looking at any stories still in progress from the last iteration, along with any pertinent information about features just finished. This should be a quick (<10 minutes) process to jog everyone’s memories and ground them in the work that’s coming up.

Starting at the top of the backlog, step through each story. Talk through the user-facing value for a feature, ensure that any comps, wires, assets, flows, and data are attached to the story. Clarify any acceptance criteria. The goal here is to be crystal clear on when a feature is “done done”.

## Complexity check

If it doesn’t already have an estimate, each developer that could work on a story estimates points to deliver. If the implementation is not clear, they have time to talk through approaches. Developer's role is to estimate the level of complexity, not pin themselves to a specific technical implementation. Based on the estimate size or developer feedback, stories can be nominated for merging or splitting up. If that’s the case, capture the pieces of work as placeholders and update with details after the Iteration Planning Meeting



## Pay down debt

A healthy development process will incorporate refactors and tackle technical debt in concert with new user value. In addition to explicit tech debt chores, Product Managers and developers look for opportunities to wrap this work into feature development. For example, if a story calls for adding a field to an existing form, we can consider also cleaning up the logic that delivers form validation errors.

## Two iterations, max 

Chunk stories into iterations, based on the team’s velocity. Only step through stories until we have two iterations worth of estimated work. Keep the visibility to two weeks to cover for quicker than intended delivery of features, and limit the Iteration Planning Meeting to a reasonable amount of upcoming work. 

It’s taxing to keep the mental inventory of features in our heads; sticking with the short term future focuses everyone on the team around tangible new features.

## Keep it short and sweet. 

Once you hit an hour of Iteration Planning, people zone out and business owners get antsy. When we have a large team, it’s especially important to play "time cop". If we don’t have a healthy backlog and find ourselves with a lack of new work, end the meeting. It’s far better to hold an emergency Iteration Planning Meeting two days later than to suffer the pain of making up stories in real time.
